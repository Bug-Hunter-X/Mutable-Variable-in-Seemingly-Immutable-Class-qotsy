This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Scala related to the misuse of mutable variables within what appears to be an immutable class. The example showcases a class that seems immutable at first glance because it uses `val` for its name property. However, the private `_age` variable is mutable using a setter method, which can lead to unexpected behavior and concurrency issues. The solution provides a revised implementation that ensures the class is truly immutable. The provided examples illustrate common errors and showcase how to maintain immutability in Scala to prevent such issues.
